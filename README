This code will loop through a binary file names "smtest" which contains 2D particle positions and type, sending each frame to the voro++ container class for analysis using periodic boundary conditions and the radical tessellation.

It is currently hardwired for certain particles types
type=1, radius=0.7
type=2, radius=0.5

The code will determine the overall voronoi statistics for the frame.
It may also be useful to do a by radius (type) analysis, since it is clear from the example data that larger particles tend to have seven-sided voronoi cells while the smaller particles tend to have 5-sided cells.
