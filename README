TO USE:
(1) Compile and install voro++ (see link below),
    http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/download/
    
    this compiled code will live in the directory of your choice, for example
    
    $HOME/analysis_codes/voro++/	     

(2) Create a new subdirectory in the examples subdirectory:

    $HOME/analysis_codes/voro++/examples/voronoi_2D

(3) Download all source code (mpp.c, mpp.h, radical_2D.cc) and the Makefile

(4) The current Makefile is primitive, basically I stapled on mpp.c
    to a perfectly good Makefile written by Chris Rycroft.
    However, you should be able to run "make" in the command line	     
    and produce the executable "radical_2D"

(5) The code is currently hardwired to assume the binary movie file "smtest"
    is in the local directory.
    
(6) The WILL not run without input_files/Pa0
    a version may be found on github.
    This may also be fixed.

Assuming everything compiles...

This code will loop through a binary file names "smtest"
which contains 2D particle positions and type,
sending each frame to the voro++ container class
for analysis using periodic boundary conditions and the radical tessellation.

It is currently hardwired for certain particles types
type=1, radius=0.7
type=2, radius=0.5

The code will determine the overall voronoi statistics for the frame.

It may also be useful to do a by radius (type) analysis,
since it is clear from the example data that larger particles
tend to have seven-sided voronoi cells while
the smaller particles tend to have 5-sided cells.
